> *"someone said we need to track pollution so here we are i guess"*

## what this thing does 🤷‍♂️

collecting environmental data across india because apparently thats important now

we track:
- air quality (its bad everywhere dont worry)
- water stuff (rivers are basically soup at this point)
- glaciers (they keep disappearing for some reason)
- oil spills (companies polluting oceans like its their job)
- fires (everything burns eventually)

## how it works probably 💭

### rahu downloads things
rahu is supposed to fetch data from various sources. sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt. computers are weird like that.

sources include government websites and satellite data and other boring stuff

### ketu processes the mess
ketu takes whatever rahu found and tries to make it useful. mostly it just complains about missing data and broken file formats.

honestly ketu does most of the work here but nobody appreciates it

## the boring data we collect 📊

**Air Quality Index**
- delhi: terrible as expected
- mumbai: also terrible  
- bangalore: surprisingly not terrible

**Water Quality** 💧
checked some rivers. they have water in them technically. quality varies from bad to worse.

**Glaciers** 🏔️
himalayan ice keeps melting. probably related to all that pollution we mentioned earlier.

**Oil Spills** 🛢️
rivers occasionally turn black. mystery solved: its oil.

**Forest Fires** 🌲🔥
trees catch fire. who could have predicted this shocking turn of events.

## tech stuff that breaks 💻

- python because its what everyone uses
- sql for databases and sadness
- apache hive because big data sounds important  
- mapreduce for processing large datasets slowly
- matplotlib for making charts nobody will read

## installation 🚀

```bash
git clone this repository
cd into the folder  
pip install requirements
python run.py --hope-it-works
```

*may cause mild depression about state of environment*

## what you get 📈

- daily aqi numbers (hint: theyre high)
- water contamination levels (also high)
- glacier retreat measurements (going down)
- oil spill coordinates (going everywhere)
- fire frequency data (going up)

see a pattern here? everything is getting worse but at least we have graphs

## contributing 🤝

feel free to submit pull requests if you want. just dont expect quick responses because debugging is hard and life is harder.

what we need:
- better error handling (currently we just print "oops" and move on)
- actual documentation (this readme doesnt count)
- someone who understands how apis work
- patience with broken government data sources

## license 📝

mit license because sharing is caring even when everything is falling apart

*"making environmental destruction slightly more organized since whenever we started this"* ✨

## final notes 💭

started this project for college assignment. now its become a daily reminder that humans are terrible at taking care of things.

code probably has bugs but so does the environment so were consistent.

if anything breaks just restart it. works for computers. doesnt work for glaciers unfortunately.

**project motto**: *"documenting disaster one csv file at a time"*

oh and if professors read this: yes i spent more time on this readme than the actual analysis. priorities.
